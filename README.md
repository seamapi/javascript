JavaScript SDK for the Seam API written in TypeScript.

_This repository hosts the next major version of the Seam JavaScript SDK.
This SDK is available for early preview.
It will eventually replace the [seamapi](https://github.com/seamapi/javascript/) package._

## Description

[Seam] makes it easy to integrate IoT devices with your applications.
This is an official SDK for the Seam API.
Please refer to the official [Seam Docs] to get started.

The SDK is fully tree-shakeable
and optimized for use in both client and server applications.

The repository does not contain the SDK code.
Instead, it re-exports from a core set of Seam modules.

_While this SDK is still in preview,
please refer to the individual README files in these repositories for
additional usage documentation not yet available in the primary Seam documentation.
See [this issue for a draft migration guide](https://github.com/seamapi/javascript-next/issues/1) from the seamapi package._

if using [nvm], install the correct version with

```
$ nvm install
```

Set the active version for each shell session with

```
$ nvm use
```

#### Manual

Publish a new version by triggering a [version workflow_dispatch on GitHub Actions].
The `version` input will be passed as the first argument to [npm-version].

This may be done on the web or using the [GitHub CLI] with

```
$ gh workflow run version.yml --raw-field version=<version>
```

[GitHub CLI]: https://cli.github.com/
[npm-version]: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version
