### Bootstrapping a new project

1. [Trigger a makenew workflow from this repository][makenew workflow]. 🚀
   - Provide a value for each required input.
   - There are no defaults.
   - Example values are shown in parentheses.
2. When the workflow completes, clone your new repo and start coding!

### Updating from this skeleton

If you want to pull in future updates from this skeleton,
you can fetch and merge in changes from this repository.

Add this as a new remote with

```
$ git remote add makenew git@github.com:seamapi/makenew-tsmodule.git
```

You can then fetch and merge changes with

```
$ git fetch --no-tags makenew
$ git merge makenew/main
```

## Installation

Add this as a dependency to your project using [npm]
by adding the line below to your project's `.npmrc`,

```
@seamapi:registry=https://npm.pkg.github.com
```

and installing the package with

```
$ npm install @seamapi/makenew-tsmodule
```

[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/

## Development and Testing

### Quickstart

```
$ git clone https://github.com/seamapi/makenew-tsmodule.git
$ cd makenew-tsmodule
$ nvm install
$ npm install
$ npm run test:watch
```

Primary development tasks are defined under `scripts` in `package.json`
and available via `npm run`.
View them with

```
$ npm run
```

### Source code

The [source code] is hosted on GitHub.
Clone the project with

```
$ git clone git@github.com:seamapi/makenew-tsmodule.git
```

[source code]: https://github.com/seamapi/makenew-tsmodule

### Requirements

You will need [Node.js] with [npm] and a [Node.js debugging] client.

Be sure that all commands run under the correct Node version, e.g.,
if using [nvm], install the correct version with

```
$ nvm install
```

Set the active version for each shell session with

```
$ nvm use
```

Ensure you are authenticated with the [GitHub Packages npm registry],
then install the development dependencies with

```
$ npm install
```

[Node.js]: https://nodejs.org/
[Node.js debugging]: https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/debugging-getting-started/
[npm]: https://www.npmjs.com/
[nvm]: https://github.com/creationix/nvm
[GitHub Packages npm registry]: https://docs.github.com/en/packages/working-with-a-github-packages-registry/working-with-the-npm-registry#authenticating-to-github-packages

### Publishing

#### Automatic

New versions are released automatically with [semantic-release]
as long as commits follow the [Angular Commit Message Conventions].

[Angular Commit Message Conventions]: https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/semantic-release/#commit-message-format
[semantic-release]: https://semantic-release.gitbook.io/

#### Manual

Publish a new version by triggering a [version workflow_dispatch on GitHub Actions].
The `version` input will be passed as the first argument to [npm-version].

This may be done on the web or using the [GitHub CLI] with

```
$ gh workflow run version.yml --raw-field version=<version>
```

[GitHub CLI]: https://cli.github.com/
[npm-version]: https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/version
[version workflow_dispatch on GitHub Actions]: https://github.com/seamapi/makenew-tsmodule/actions?query=workflow%3Aversion

## GitHub Actions

  `packages:write` and `contents:write` permission.
- `GIT_USER_NAME`: The GitHub bot user's real name.
- `GIT_USER_EMAIL`: The GitHub bot user's email.
- `GPG_PRIVATE_KEY`: The GitHub bot user's [GPG private key].
- `GPG_PASSPHRASE`: The GitHub bot user's GPG passphrase.
